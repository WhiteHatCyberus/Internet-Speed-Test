# Internet-Speed-Test
This program is purely implemented in python and resembles the functionalities of other network speedtests on the internet.
Ive added the entire detailed documentation within the code and I hope you find this useful for educational purposes.

# Requirememnts
The system must have Python3 and pip installed.

# Description
I've used the speedtest-cli module and for convenience to new users, the program will automatically download the module before execution!

# The Big Question, HOW DOES IT LOOK?
Ive put in 2-3hrs overall on this project so that it is highly user friendly and hassle-free to navigate and understand the interface.
