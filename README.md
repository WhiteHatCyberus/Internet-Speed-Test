# Internet-Speed-Test
<p>This program is purely implemented in python and resembles the functionalities of other network speedtests on the internet.<br></p>
Ive added the entire detailed documentation within the code and I hope you find this useful for educational purposes.

# Requirememnts
The system must have Python3 and pip installed.

# Description
I've used the speedtest-cli module and for convenience to new users, the program will automatically download the module before execution!
